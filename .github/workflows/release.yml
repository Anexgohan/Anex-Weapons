# create-src-release - this will create two src.zip with source code ignoring files & folders listed in ".gitattributes"
# build-npm - This workflow will do a clean installation of node dependencies, cache/restore them, build the source code and run tests across different versions of node.
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-nodejs-with-github-actions
# create-zip-release - this will create a separate release zip file with only contents for end user, basically what you deliver to end user.
