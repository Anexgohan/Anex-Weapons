anexweapons_mm_achuk_missile,WEAPON,"A fire and forget missile with medium range and low speed and tracking. Collapse shields with brute force and consistent barrage.",- "You know, The Achuk project almost got cancelled. We went way overbudget for that one, rather sloppy really.. They just wanted us to build a competitor to the pillum. I think they were so impressed by what we built instead it saved our jobs.",,,
anexweapons_mm_sudarshan_missile,WEAPON,"EMP delivery missiles with shield bursting capability to disable even the sturdiest of ships. Deals flux damage on Shields and EMP damage on Hull.",- "To be honest, i was always absolutely terrified of the guidance we put on those things, i know IFF has a 94.963- yada-yada percent success rate, but surely when were firing so many against a live fire PD test there should- - RND accident Log F-28 (PURGE ASAP)",,,
anexweapons_mm_vajra_missile,WEAPON,"Engine buster missile, large spread to evade even the tightest of PD fire.",- "Oh man, I remember that! We made some stupid bet with with that guy across the department, said he'd pay our lunches for a year if we could triple the payload on that capacitor missile we were working on, So what we did right? We just fucking doubled up the payload on this anti-fighter missile and put one of those fusion lamp activators in there. It nearly blinded the entire test crew but we still won.. That's how we got reassigned.",,,
anexweapons_mm_bhairav_missile,WEAPON,"A fire and forget torpedo with good range but very low speed and tracking. Flux damage on shield impact.",- "When they Told us they wanted a 'Anti-Shield' torpedo without a sabot most of the team just outright denied the possibility, i mean how would you even build a payload to do that effectively? After some dead-end work they brought in this dusty spacer, didn't like em at first.. But he could make anything a deadly explosive. I remember one of the test models was literally an unstable phase coil... It was too powerful for production.",,,
anexweapons_mm_lakshya_missile,WEAPON,"Anti-Fighter, Anti-Missile, saturate the battle field with 12 self guided pods.",- "I really never liked my work on that thing, the only reason we had it was because some director stole it out from under ballistics nose, i still remember the time they docked my pay after the proximity sensor failed, it had something like a 6% failure rate, the odds of it failing in that test was microscopic! Pretty sure that director got fired at some point, good riddance.",,,
anexweapons_mm_trishul_missile,WEAPON,"Unguided, slow moving hybrid between a Torpedo and a missile with raw damage output. Hits can Bypass shields and deliver EMP burst to the target.",- "Funny story actually, I got reassigned to Missile RND for a bit.. They brought in some old fusion lamp parts thinking they may be able to boost up the engines or something, I.. Put em on the right path, i don't think I'll ever get over the shock when they saw the gamma blast completely vaporize the test target.",,,

anexweapons_mtb_dhwij_turret,WEAPON,"Dual barrel rapid fire main gun turret, Effective against Shields and flux efficient.",- "Originally the turret was planned to be an integrated gun We packed an absurd amount of firepower into those first models, it was a miracle you could classify it as a medium at all.. It was so good, management decided it wanted to mount them on everything.. I can barely remember the scramble, we had other teams in overnight, i was awake for a few days at a time more then once.. But clearly it worked out in the end.",,,
anexweapons_mtb_pinaka_turret,WEAPON,"Dual barrel rapid fire PD with advanced gyros and independent lock and tracking AI built in. Fires a constant stream of super charged shrapnel that detonate on proximity.",,,,
