Step 1. Copy paste a vanilla missile weapon .wpn and it's respective missile .proj
Step 2. Change the names and IDs of your copies
Step 3. Change other stuff if needed
Step 4. Add the entry to your weapon .csv
Literally that simple

Weapons can have up to four sprite layers:
“base” renders under everything and (IIRC) doesn’t rotate with the rest of the weapon. 
“recoil” is the gun barrels, any bit of the weapon you want to visually recoil when firing. 
“_” the main weapon sprite sits above the recoil sprite, doesn’t move but can be given frame by frame animation. 
“glow” gives a glow effect when the weapon fires.
The main weapon sprite is usually the one without a suffix, hence why it’s easy to get confused with “_base” which is different.
Most vanilla weapons use at least two of these layers, some use more or less. Missile launchers tend to only use a main sprite, because they don’t need recoil or glows (though you can absolutely use them for your own content!)
The game also allows to specify two completely separate sprite SETS for each turret and hardpoint mountings, so your weapon can appear differently when mounted in a turret or hardpoint slot. That might be what the wiki is referring to. You don’t actually NEED two different sprites, if you’re just starting you can just have one and reference it in the .wpn file as both turret and hardpoint appearances.

-----------------	
SYSTEM 				- The weapon will not spawn in markets, not drop as loot from killing a ship carrying it, and not show up in the Codex.

SHOW_IN_CODEX 		- Forces a "SYSTEM" weapon to show up in the Codex anyway. (See: Thermal Pulse Cannon)


PD 					- Makes the weapon target and prioritize missiles. (Weapons without this tag can always target fighters.)

PD_ALSO 			- Unknown, seems to only be used by the Devastator Cannon.

PD_ONLY 			- Unsure. Perhaps means the weapon will not be fired offensively against ships. Seems to only be used by the frag bombs launched by Wasp Interceptor Drones.

ANTI_FTR 			- Unsure. Perhaps prioritizes aiming at fighter craft instead of warships.


STRIKE 				- Use this weapon as a strike tool. Possibly changes what situations the AI uses the weapon in combat. Usually applies to missiles.

USE_VS_FRIGATES 	- Forces a "STRIKE" weapon to be fired against frigates.

DO_NOT_AIM			- Don't bother to point at your target while firing this weapon. Applies to guided missiles.

GUIDED_POOR 		- In contrast to "DO_NOT_AIM", suggests that while it is not vital to aim before firing, it is preferable if circumstances allow it.

HEATSEEKER 			- The weapon is a heatseeking missile. Only used by Salamander MRM launchers (small and medium).

BOMB 				- Unsure. Perhaps tells the game the weapon is unpowered and requires momentum to be delivered.


DO_NOT_CONSERVE 	- Fire the weapon whenever you have the opportunity, don't bother to save ammo. Applies to missiles/finite ammo weapons.

CONSERVE_1 / CONSERVE_3 / CONSERVE_5 	- Presumeably the ship will attempt to save ammunition so it doesn't run out of shots right at the start of a battle. Numbers perhaps represent necessity to conserve?

EXTRA_RANGE_ON_FIGHTER 					- Unsure. Perhaps makes fighter craft fire this weapon from a longer range than a warship would. Seems to only be used on single-shot Sabot.

FIRE_WHEN_INEFFICIENT 					- Unsure. Used on some beam weapons.
