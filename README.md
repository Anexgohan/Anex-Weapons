The Mod is in Development

[b]Requirement:[/b]
Need balance testers for weapons 
Need help writing interesting details for those weapons

[b] What the mod is about:[/b]
I felt the need to add Weapons to the game specially Missiles for now and needed to learn how to make mods so here we are.
I have a background in graphics and 3d and being a fan of SS since its start so this is my contribution to the game I love so much other than throwing money at Alex.

[b]What's the vision/lore :[/b]
Arjuna Industries started as a subsidiary of the Tri-Tachyon supplying them with low-end materials in the beginning to recent high-tech parts manufacturing, mostly stealth tech and missile weapons design, as the company grew so did its ambitions strategically acquiring and merging with other smaller manufacturers Arjuna Industries supplies the bulk of Tri-Tachyon weapon components, with such a monopoly over weapons manufacture the uneasy Tri-Tachyon tried to diversify and move past this long and fruitful alliance.

Things did not turn out well for Arjuna Industries as one sanction after another and mostly one client and that too turn hostile Arjuna Industries nearly lost most of its advantages over its competing rival companies. The final push came when Tri-Tachyon tried to gain a hostile takeover of Arjuna Industries via its own rival company. 
Tri-Tachyon would have succeeded if it were not for the large scale disruptions caused by the gate collapse and the following Second AI War against Hegemony, the Tri-Tachyon stranglehold on Arjuna Industries weakened over the years.

Arjuna Industries in a desperate attempt for survival and over several years in silence began shifting its HQ to a secret location and after that shut all its manufacturing across the known space in an instant, for a long while no one knew where Arjuna Industries disappeared, abandoning all its commitments and service contracts. All its weapons and equipment fell into disarray and state of disrepair, the reputation loss caused Arjuna Industries manufactured equipment to become a joke amongst spacefarers only seemed fit for the lowest of the lowest, the unluckiest of the unlucky.

But recently across the black boards some agents can be seen selling brand new Arjuna Industries marked weapons and on open markets, although finding very few willing to purchase due to its tarnished reputation and general disbelief that it is a genuine new Arjuna Industries product, those who have tried these weapons speak extremely highly of these weapons.
Only time will tell if Arjuna Industries has made a comeback or some pretender has claimed its name instead.
For now, purchase these weapons keeping in mind the risks involved.

[b]More missiles why:[/b]
Starsector has some very decent weapons but I feel missiles are not given the justice they need, look at the current world around you it is held peacefully with the fear of missiles, not tanks, not infantry and not guns. So it's strange to me that missiles in SS are not the same mayhem causing fear-inducing war machines that they really are in a future where armoured ships are flying and not just cylindrical tin cans.

[b]Balance:[/b]
Balance is an ongoing process I the mod maker will always be biased to my creations, so I need your help in bringing sanity to my insanity, test it for me and report back either here or discord, if on discord please tag @Anexgohan
