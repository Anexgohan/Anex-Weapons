The Mod is in Development

# Requirement:
Need balance testers for weapons 
Need help writing interesting details for those weapons

# What the mod is about:
I felt the need to add Weapons to the game specially Missiles for now and needed to learn how to make mods so here we are.
I have a background in graphics and 3d and being a fan of SS since its start so this is my contribution to the game I love so much other than throwing money at Alex.

# What's the vision/lore :
Arjuna Industries started as a subsidiary of the Tri-Tachyon supplying them with low-end materials in the beginning to recent high-tech parts manufacturing, mostly stealth tech, missile weapons design and manufacturing, as the company grew so did its ambitions, strategically acquiring and merging with other smaller manufacturers Arjuna Industries supplied the bulk of Tri-Tachyon weapon components. 
The Tri-Tachyon took notice of this situation and they were not comfortable with such a monopoly over weapons manufacture not under their majority control, the uneasy Tri-Tachyon tried to diversify and move past this long and fruitful alliance.

Things did not turn out well for Arjuna Industries as one sanction after another and mostly one client and that too turn hostile, Arjuna Industries nearly lost most of its advantages over its competing rival companies. The final push came when Tri-Tachyon tried to initiate a hostile takeover of Arjuna Industries via its rival company.
Tri-Tachyon would have succeeded if it were not for the large scale disruptions caused by the gate collapse and the following Second AI War against Hegemony, the Tri-Tachyon stranglehold on Arjuna Industries weakened over the years.

Arjuna Industries came into possession of knowledge of a vast and resource rich region on the outer edges of travelled space with several hyperspace lanes leading up to it, untouched by the domain and its Remnants and far from the influence of the Core Worlds during the scavenging of a defunct observatory at the edge of the sector. All mention of this scavenge was purged and every person involved was either hunted down or promoted within Arjuna Industries. 

Arjuna Industries knew what had to be done and in a desperate attempt for survival and over several years began in silence shifting its HQ to a secret location and after that shut all its manufacturing across the known space in an instant, for a long while no one knew where Arjuna Industries disappeared, abandoning all its commitments and service contracts. All its weapons and equipment fell into disarray and state of disrepair, the reputation loss caused Arjuna Industries manufactured equipment to become a joke amongst spacefarers only seemed fit for the lowest of the lowest, the unluckiest of the unlucky.

But recently across the black boards, some independent agents can be seen selling brand new Arjuna Industries marked weapons and on open markets, although finding very few willing to purchase due to its tarnished reputation and general disbelief that it is a genuine new Arjuna Industries product, those who have tried these weapons speak extremely highly of these weapons.

Arjuna Industries trade fleets compose of AI-controlled ships with a single captain and two to three crew who never get off from their ships even for negations, they make trade deals to sell weapons and high tech gear in exchange for common supplies and hardware, money or profits is of no interest to them. The Hegemony recently stopped their AI fleet and challenged them to stand down, in the resulting fight when Arjuna Industries AI fleet lost and was disabled, the entire convoy blew themselves up then be boarded, is this loyalty of their crew or AI influence no one knows. For now, they come from shadows trade their high tech gear for cheap goods and return to vast depths of empty space those who tried following them seem to be taken for a ride system hopping one jump lane to other eventually running out of supplies and backing off in disappointment. No one knows why they come and where they go, everyone who trades with them gets rich.

Only time will tell if Arjuna Industries has made a comeback or some pretender has claimed its name instead.
For now, purchase these weapons keeping in mind the risks involved. And do not try to look for them they do not want to be found.

# More missiles why:
Starsector has some very decent weapons but I feel missiles are not given the justice they need, look at the current world around you it is held peacefully with the fear of missiles, not tanks, not infantry and not guns. So it's strange to me that missiles in SS are not the same mayhem causing fear-inducing war machines that they really are in a future where armoured ships are flying and not just cylindrical tin cans.

# Balance:
Balance is an ongoing process I the mod maker will always be biased to my creations, so I need your help in bringing sanity to my insanity, test it for me and report back either here or discord, if on discord please tag @Anexgohan
